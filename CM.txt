Orchestrator Servers are the core components of System Center Orchestrator (SCO), responsible for running and managing the automation workflows, known as runbooks. These servers are crucial to the operation of Orchestrator, as they execute the tasks defined in the runbooks and manage communication between the different components of the Orchestrator environment.

Aim: Manage Orchestrator Servers.
6A: Manage Orchestrator Servers-1
Note: Establishing a connection with the User VM and Domain Controller by connecting the User VM to the Domain Controller’s Workgroup
6A-1: Runbook permissions
Runbook access permissions are set through the Runbook Designer. By default, only users in the Orchestrator Users Group have full access to a runbook. Here We Add additional User and give access to additional users to run, start, stop, view, and change runbooks at either the folder level or the individual runbook level.
Pre-requisites:
Domain Controller (Here Domain Controller Name Winser (New))
User Server (Here User Name SCO_PRAC6)

•	To create a User first we require the Active Directory Domain Service which can be added through the Server Manager
•	Open Server Manager and Click on Add Roles and Features

•	Click on Next
•	Select Role-based or Feature-based installation and Click Next
•	Keep default settings and Click on Next
•	Select Active Directory Domain Service and Click on Add Feature and Click on Next
•	Select the following feature and Click on Next
•	Click on Next

•	Click on Ok
•	Now the Domain Controller will be added, Click on the Domain Controller and Click on Users
•	Right Click on Users and Click New and User
•	Type in a new User name (here it is SCO) and Click Next
•	Type in a password and Select Password never expires and Click Next
•	Click on Finish
•	Add the User to the Domain Group, Right Click on SCDPM and Select Add to a group

•	Type in Administrator and Click on Check Names and Click on Ok
•	Click on OK


Step 2: View or modify the permissions of a runbook

•	Open Runbook Designer
•	Runbook Designer Window Open
•	In the Runbook Designer, in the Connections pane, select the Runbooks folder
•	In the Runbook Designer Design workspace, right-click the tab for a runbook to select Permissions.
•	To give another user or security group access to the runbook, select the Add button.
•	select the user or security group from the local computer or from the domain.
•	Here in Window Type SCO and Click on Check Names

•	Click on Ok

6A-3: Optimize performance of .NET activities
Improve assembly load time
When a runbook containing an activity that references the .NET assemblies executes, the job process has to load the referenced assembly when such an activity is executed. Any subsequent execution of the same activity or other activities from the assembly will reuse the loaded assembly.
Loading an assembly may cause a delay of up to 30 seconds. This delay can also occur when a runbook is started on a computer without Internet access, because Windows can't verify the Microsoft Authenticode signature for the .NET assemblies.
To remove the delay you can either deactivate generatePublisherEvidence in PolicyModule.exe, or you can create a profile for the service account.
Step 4: Deactivate generatePublisherEvidence in policymodule.exe.config.
•	Locate the file C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft System Center\Orchestrator\Runbook Server\policymodule.exe.config on the runbook server that executes runbooks containing an activity referencing a .NET assembly.

•	Open policymodule.exe.config File on Notepad.
•	Add the following code to policymodule.exe.config:

6B: Manage Orchestrator Servers-2
6B-1: recover web components
When you use the Database Configuration utility to modify the Orchestrator database, the tool won’t modify the Web Service database reference (only the installer performs this task). You will need to manually modify it after updating with the database configuration utility.
Step 5: Modify the Web Service database 
Decrypt the connection string
•	Open a Command Prompt using Run as administrator.

•	Execute the following command (assuming the default installation path):
•	Decryption of Connection String Succeeded

•	Open Server Manager Click on Tools Within Tools Select Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
•	Click on Sites Within Sites Click on Orchestrator2012
•	Double Click on Connection Strings

•	Right-Click on OrchestratorContext and Click on Edit
•	Open SQL Server Manager Within Database Create a New Database and Give Name rahul_data
•	Click on SQL Server Enter SQL Server Name (Here Server Name: WIN-BFN7GTBLDD6) and Database Name (Here Database Name: rahul_data)
•	Click on Ok
•	In Connection String Server Name Database Name
•	re-encrypt the connection strings, you can execute the following command at the command prompt:
•	Here we Can Encryption of Connecting Strings Succeeded.

6B-2: Add an integration pack
Step 6: Install System Center (SC) 2016

•	Click on Next
•	Keep default values and Click on Next
•	In the Completing Integration Pack Deployment Wizard dialog, select Finish.
•	When the integration pack is deployed, the Log Entries dialog displays a confirmation message.

6B-3: Change Orchestrator user groups
Step 9: We can change the Orchestrator Users group by using the PermissionsConfig tool, which is located on the management server in <InstallDir>\Management Server.
•	Open Management Server File On CMD
Type Following Code:
•	PermissionsConfig.exe
•	PermissionsConfig -OrchestratorUsersGroup Administrator -OrchestratorUser SCO [-remote]
